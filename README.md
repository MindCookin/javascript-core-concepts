# javascript-core-concepts

I will try to unveil the core concepts of the Javascript language to ease its learning curve.

Based on Douglas Crockford's [The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do)

Hope it'll help to find answers to strange JS behavior and aid to prevent them.

1. [Core](https://github.com/MindCookin/javascript-core-concepts/tree/master/core). Javascript interpreter particularities.
2. [Objects](https://github.com/MindCookin/javascript-core-concepts/tree/master/objects). Understanding the JS object system.
3. [Functions](https://github.com/MindCookin/javascript-core-concepts/tree/master/functions). JS first class citizens.
