# Functions

> _"The best thing about Javascript is its implementation of functions. It got almost everything right. But, as you ahould expect with Javascript, it didn't get everything right."_ Douglas Crockford

### function are objects

Functions in Javascript are just like any other JS Object. They inherit from `Function.prototype` (who also inherit from `Object.prototype`).

###Â invocation and `this` keyword

When executing a function _as is_ (Function Invocation Pattern) `this` keyword is bind to the global object.

When the function is stored as an object's property, we will execute the function _as a method_ (Method Invocation Pattern). Then `this` is bound to the object at invocation time

When a function is invoked with the `new` prefix, then a new object is created (with a hidden link to the function's prototype) and `this` will be bound to that new object. This is the Constructor Invocation Pattern

> There are some drawbacks with the Constructor Invocation Pattern #TODO

When a function is invoked with `apply` or `call`, you can choose the `this` binding at execution time.

### binding `this`

You may create a function instance binding `this` dynamically at execution time. This is particularly useful with callback functions. It is important to notice that a new instance of the function will be created when executing bind.

### function scope

Instead of common "block scope" languages like C, Javascript has **"function scope"**.

This means that scope is contained inside a function, and curly brace blocks do not really mean encapsulation block. Better with an example:

```
// C like scope (FAKE JAVASCRIPT)

function() { // scope 1

  var foo = 'foo';

  if (foo) { // scope 2

    var baz = 'baz' // will only be seen inside the conditional block

  } // end scope 2

  console.log(foo) // 'foo'
  console.log(baz) // undefined

} // end scope 1
```

```
// TRUE JAVASCRIPT scope

function() { // scope 1

  var foo = 'foo';

  if (foo) { // do not change scope!

    var baz = 'baz' // baz var is created in function scope
  }

  console.log(foo) // 'foo'
  console.log(baz) // 'baz'

} // end scope 1
```

> With ES6 _let_ key word you can encapsulate variables in block scopes.

### closures
Understanding function scopes bring us to closures. Closures are the capability of sharing parent scope between functions.

It is easier to see with an example:
```
function outerFunction() {

  var outerVar = 'outer';

  function innerFunction () {
    var innerVar = 'inner';

    console.log(outerVar) // 'outer'
    console.log(innerVar) // 'inner'
  }

  console.log(outerVar) // 'outer'
  console.log(innerVar) // undefined
}
```
